<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started using Wordpress in 2018, for four years after using Wordpress I realized the limitations of using Wordpress, So I decided to start learning HTML.</p>

<p>Today I have created over 10 websites using HTML, from a birthday invitaion website to movies ranking site and so on and so fourth.</p>

<p>Looking into the future, I look forward to creating as many websites as possible using code. I'm highly passionate about finance & I look forward to creating my own money transfer app or an exchange for crypto or stocks</p>
